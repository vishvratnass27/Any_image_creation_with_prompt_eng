**GitHub README: OpenAI Image Generation**

# Overview
This code demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate visually stunning images based on textual prompts. In this example, we'll create an image of Ironman in his iconic suit, showcasing his powerful presence and technological brilliance.

# Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `openai`: To interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
- `requests`: To handle HTTP requests for image retrieval.
- `IPython.display`: To display the generated image.

# Usage
1. Get Your OpenAI API Key:
   - Visit [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - Generate or use an existing API key and replace `"Please Enter OpneAI Seacret Key"` in the code with your key.

2. Run the Code:
   - Run the script, and it will use the GPT-3 model to generate an image based on the provided prompt.

3. Image Generation:
   - The code sends the prompt to the API, which generates an image of Ironman.
   - The generated image is saved as `myimage.png` in the current directory.

4. Display the Image:
   - The code utilizes `IPython.display` to display the generated image.

# Customize the Prompt
Feel free to customize the `prompt` variable to generate images based on different concepts or ideas. Just replace the text inside the `prompt` with your desired description or request for an image.

# Note
Remember to keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

Enjoy generating beautiful images with GPT-3!
